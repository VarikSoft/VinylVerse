# 🎵 VinylVerse

**VinylVerse** is a desktop music app built as a student project — completed just 16 hours before the deadline (yes, really 😅).  
Developed in **C#** with **WPF**, it supported streaming via a custom server using NuGet-based delivery.

> The server is long gone and the backend no longer works, but I’m leaving the code here — maybe someone finds it useful someday.  
> Just be warned: the code is absolute spaghetti. This was a "get it done or die" kind of project.
